💡 Project Insights
📈 Overall Sales Performance
1. Total revenue varies clearly across years and months, revealing peak seasons 🎯 for promotions and inventory planning
2. USA and a few other key countries contribute the highest revenue share - priority markets for retention and upsell strategies 🌍

🛒 Product Insights
3. Classic Cars and premium product lines generate the largest share of total sales - core revenue drivers 🏆
2. Small set of top products (e.g., S18_3232) account for significant revenue - strong "hero product" effect ⭐
1. Lower-performing lines contribute less revenue - re-position, bundle, or discount for better performance 📉➡️📈

👥 Customer Behavior
1. Limited high-value customers contribute a large share of sales - focus on relationship management & loyalty programs ❤️
2. Monthly quantity vs sales analysis shows high volume doesn't always mean high revenue - discounting insights ⚠️
3. Customer segmentation by revenue/frequency identifies loyal, at-risk, and new customers for targeted campaigns 🎯
