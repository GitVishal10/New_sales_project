## 💡 Project Insights

### 📈 Overall Sales Performance
- **Total revenue** varies clearly across years and months, revealing **peak seasons** 🎯 for promotions and inventory planning
- **USA** and few other key countries contribute highest revenue share - **priority markets** for retention and upsell strategies 🌍

### 🛒 Product Insights
- **Classic Cars** and premium product lines generate **largest share** of total sales - **core revenue drivers** 🏆
- Small set of **top products** (e.g., **S18_3232**) account for significant revenue - strong **"hero product"** effect ⭐
- Lower-performing lines contribute less revenue - **re-position, bundle, or discount** for better performance 📉➡️📈

### 👥 Customer Behavior
- **Limited high-value customers** contribute large share of sales - focus on **relationship management** & loyalty programs ❤️
- Monthly **quantity vs sales** analysis shows high volume doesn't always mean high revenue - **discounting insights** ⚠️
- **Customer segmentation** by revenue/frequency identifies **loyal, at-risk, new customers** for targeted campaigns 🎯
